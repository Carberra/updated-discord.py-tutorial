This repository contains all the code for the bot constructed over the course of my series "Building a discord.py bot (2020)", which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYeOw6sTSy6ZGyygcbta7GcpI8a5-Cooc.

## Installation of required components

### You will need:
- Python 3.8.0 or higher;
- `discord.py` version 1.3.0 or higher;
- `discord-ext-menus` version 1.0.0a or higher;
- `apscheduler` version 3.6.3 or higher.

### To install Python:
#### Windows/MacOS:
Download the latest version from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
#### Linux
Grab the python3 package from your distro's repository, not from the website. This will ensure that you can update it along side with your other packages.
  
### Pip installs:
#### On Unix based systems:
`python3.x -m pip install discord.py apscheduler git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus` (replace "x" with your subversion).
#### On Windows:
`pip install discord.py discord.py apscheduler git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus`, or `py -m pip install discord.py discord.py apscheduler git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus`
